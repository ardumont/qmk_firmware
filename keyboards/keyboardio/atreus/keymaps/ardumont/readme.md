This is a qwerty layout for the keyboardio/atreus. For the most part, it's a
straightforward layout. Only the modifiers key are not organized like the default
layout. Those modifier keys are mostly symmetrically configured.

Exceptions to the rules are the `Escape` and the `Super` which only exists on the left
side of the keyboard.

The idea is that when using a modifier key, some users may expect to use both side of
the keyboard symmetrically (as in emacs, qutebrowser, terminal/tmux).
